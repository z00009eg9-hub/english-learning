  intro:"這是一篇真實新聞的改寫。注意氣象報導怎麼描述位置（680 km east-northeast of Taipei）、速度（moving west at 10 kph）與範圍（a storm radius of 280 km）——這三種說法幾乎每篇颱風新聞都會出現。",

    {en:"Last Saturday the Central Weather Administration issued a sea warning for Typhoon Dolphin. At five in the afternoon the storm was about 680 kilometres east-northeast of Taipei and had been moving west at only 10 kilometres per hour — slow enough for forecasters to be confident about its path.",
     cn:"上週六，中央氣象署對颱風 Dolphin 發布了海上警報。下午五點時，這個風暴位於台北東北東方約 680 公里處，並且一直以每小時僅 10 公里的速度向西移動——慢得足以讓預報人員對它的路徑有信心。"},
    {en:"Dolphin was a moderate typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 144 kilometres per hour and a storm radius of 280 kilometres. It came closest to Taiwan on Saturday and Sunday, but it was never expected to make landfall here. Forecasters said it would probably reach China's Zhejiang Province instead.",
     cn:"Dolphin 是一個中度颱風，最大持續風速為每小時 144 公里，暴風半徑 280 公里。它在週六與週日最接近台灣，但從未預期會在此登陸。預報人員說它應該會轉而抵達中國浙江省。"},
    {en:"A typhoon does not have to land to cause problems. The heaviest rain fell on northern Taiwan and the central mountains, and the mountainous areas north of Taichung were placed under the highest rainfall alert. Long swells were expected along the north and east coasts, as well as around Green Island, Orchid Island and the Hengchun Peninsula, until Monday.",
     cn:"颱風不需要登陸也能造成問題。最強的降雨落在台灣北部與中央山區，台中以北的山區被列入最高等級的降雨警戒。北部與東部海岸，以及綠島、蘭嶼與恆春半島一帶，預期到週一都會有長浪。"},
    {en:"The advice was simple: stay away from the coastline and avoid all water activities. After the storm passed, southwesterly winds brought scattered showers to the southwest, while most of the island stayed hot and sunny with afternoon thunderstorms in the north and centre.",
     cn:"官方建議很簡單：遠離海岸線，避免所有水域活動。風暴過後，西南風為西南部帶來零星陣雨，而全島大部分地區則維持炎熱晴朗，北部與中部午後有雷雨。"}
